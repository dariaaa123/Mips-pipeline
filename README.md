### **MIPS Pipeline Implementation in VHDL**  

This project designs a **5-stage MIPS pipeline** in **VHDL**, enabling efficient instruction execution. The pipeline consists of the following stages:  

- **IF (Instruction Fetch)** – Retrieves instructions from memory.  
- **ID (Instruction Decode)** – Deciphers instructions and accesses registers.  
- **EX (Execute)** – Carries out arithmetic and logical operations.  
- **MEM (Memory Access)** – Reads from or writes to data memory.  
- **WB (Write Back)** – Stores computation results back into registers.  

The implementation includes **hazard detection and forwarding mechanisms** to optimize performance and maintain execution efficiency.
